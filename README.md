# Media Gallery

A Flutter package that allows you to easily access and display images from the device’s media gallery. It handles permissions, media access, and displaying the list of images in a user-friendly way. 

## Features

- **Access Photos**: Retrieve a list of images from the device's media gallery.
- **Permission Handling**: Automatically requests permission to access media files (with appropriate handling for Android).
- **Toast Notifications**: Provides user feedback via toast notifications when necessary actions are performed (like permissions).
- **Cross-platform**: Works on both Android and iOS (based on your implementation and support).
  
## Installation

To use the **Media Gallery** package in your Flutter project, follow these steps:

1. Add the following dependency to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     media_gal: ^1.0.0  # Replace with the actual version
   ```

2. Run the following command to fetch the package:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

## Permissions

To access the media files on Android and iOS, the package requires certain permissions.

### Android

1. Add the following permissions to your **`AndroidManifest.xml`** (located in `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`):

   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
   ```

   For devices running Android 6.0 (API level 23) and above, you also need to request permissions at runtime. This is handled by the package automatically.

### iOS

For iOS, add the following keys to your **`Info.plist`** (located in `ios/Runner/Info.plist`):

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photos to display your media gallery</string>
```

## Usage

After installing the package and configuring the permissions, you can access the gallery and display images in your Flutter application.

### Example:

Here’s a simple example of how to use the **Media Gallery** package to access and display images:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:media_gal/media_gal.dart';  // Replace with actual import

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Media Gallery Example',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: MediaGalleryScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class MediaGalleryScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MediaGalleryScreenState createState() => _MediaGalleryScreenState();
}

class _MediaGalleryScreenState extends State<MediaGalleryScreen> {
  List<String> _imagePaths = [];

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _loadImages();
  }

  Future<void> _loadImages() async {
    try {
      // Assuming getImagesFromGallery is a method in the package
      List<String> images = await MediaGallery.getImagesFromGallery();
      
      setState(() {
        _imagePaths = images;
      });
    } catch (e) {
      print("Error fetching images: $e");
    }
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: Text("Media Gallery")),
      body: _imagePaths.isEmpty
          ? Center(child: CircularProgressIndicator())
          : ListView.builder(
              itemCount: _imagePaths.length,
              itemBuilder: (context, index) {
                return Image.asset(_imagePaths[index]);  // Update this based on your implementation
              },
            ),
    );
  }
}
```

### Key Features:
- **Toast Notifications**: You can show a toast message when the app successfully fetches media or when there is an error.
  
  ```dart
  Fluttertoast.showToast(msg: "Permissions granted!");  // Example usage
  ```

- **Permission Handling**: If the user denies access to the gallery, your app will prompt them again to allow permissions, or show a suitable message using **Toast**.

### Example of Using Toast:

```dart
import 'package:fluttertoast/fluttertoast.dart';

// Show a toast message
Fluttertoast.showToast(
  msg: "This is a simple toast message",
  toastLength: Toast.LENGTH_SHORT,
  gravity: ToastGravity.BOTTOM,
  timeInSecForIosWeb: 1,
);
```

**DEPRECATION NOTICE:**

Version 1.0.0 of this package is deprecated. Please upgrade to version 1.0.1 or later for continued support and bug fixes.


### Final Notes:
- The exact method to fetch images from the gallery may vary depending on the package you're using or your custom implementation. Be sure to replace placeholder methods like `MediaGallery.getImagesFromGallery()` with the actual method from your package.
- You can further expand on this by including examples of different ways to use the package (e.g., with custom sorting, image selection, etc.).
